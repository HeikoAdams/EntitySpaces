# A Very Simple Example
The sample below demonstrates a self join on the Employees table which is looking for all employees with an 'a' in their last name who have people reporting to them. Kind of silly but it shows off the syntax. More samples available here [I'm an inline-style link with title](https://github.com/MikeGriffinReborn/EntitySpaces_DotNetStandard "Google's Homepage")

## Query and Load 
Notice we're creating a "fullName" column on the fly and will be in our JSON as we expect as shown below
```c#
EmployeesQuery e = new EmployeesQuery("e");
e.Select
(
     e.EmployeeID, 
     e.LastName, e.FirstName, 
    (e.LastName + ", " + e.FirstName).As("fullName")
)
.OrderBy(e.LastName.Descending);

EmployeesCollection coll = new EmployeesCollection();
if (coll.Load(e))
{
    // We loaded at least one record
}
```
Notice that the SQL is extremely lean.

**NOTE**: InnerJoin, RightJoin, LeftJoin, CrossJoin, and FullJoin are all supported, basically the entire SQL API is supported.

## SQL Generated and executed from the Query Above
```sql
SELECT 
    e.[EmployeeID], 
    e.[LastName], 
    e.[FirstName], 
   (e.[LastName] + ', ' + e.[FirstName]) AS 'fullName'  
FROM [Employees] e 
ORDER BY e.[LastName] DESC
```
Compare that SQL to the SQL generated by a Entity Framework query which does the same thing and you'll be shocked.

## JSON resulting from Serialization.
Notice the "fullName" is present, no need to 'new' an anonymous object as extra columns just magically appear
```json
[
  {
    "EmployeeID": 6,
    "LastName": "Suyama",
    "FirstName": "Michael",
    "fullName": "Suyama, Michael"
  },
  {
    "EmployeeID": 33,
    "LastName": "Smith",
    "FirstName": "Joe",
    "fullName": "Smith, Joe"
  },
  {
    "EmployeeID": 31,
    "LastName": "Smith",
    "FirstName": "Frank",
    "fullName": "Smith, Frank"
  }
]
```
